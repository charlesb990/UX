# UX
This repository contains the UX design project for a gaming squad application, created as part of a CIT class assignment. The project outlines a user journey with interactive screens designed to help users find a gaming squad, pick roles, enhance soundtracks, choose map strategies, equip their squad, and track mission success. It also includes an error screen design and a usability test in PDF format.
- User Journey: Step-by-step flow from squad selection to mission completion.
- Intuitive Interface: User-friendly design for seamless navigation.
- Error Handling: Dedicated error screen with clear feedback and recovery options.
- Usability Test: PDF document with test results and feedback.
